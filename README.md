# Paycheck scraper
Don't judge too harsly please! This is just some very hacky thing I did to scrape my paychecks.

## Running it
- install the stuff in requirements.txt
- change file paths in the pdfs array to point at whereever you have your stuff
- run a command like `python renta.py > renta.csv`
- open in Excel and do whatever you need :)
